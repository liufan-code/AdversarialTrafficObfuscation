# AdversarialTrafficObfuscation
This repository contains code, models, and datasets related to the research on Traffic Obfuscation based on Adversarial Machine Learning. The project focuses on limiting the machine learning model's ability to recognize anonymous traffic by adding specific disturbances to the input data. The experiment involves using the Tor network as a typical secure channel and tests various obfuscation techniques, achieving optimal performance with the MIM algorithm, achieving a 90% success rate in obfuscation against DNN and LSTM models.

## Features
- Implementation of MIM algorithm for traffic obfuscation
- Usage of Tor network for secure channel experiments
- Evaluation scripts to test the success rate of obfuscation against various models

## How to Use
Please refer to the specific README files in the respective directories for usage details and instructions.
